# Game of Thrones  

Game of Thrones is my favorite series. It’s based on books written by George R.R. Martin and aired from 2011 to 2019 on HBO. It’s about power, families fighting for the Iron Throne, and surviving in a dangerous world.

## Why I Like It  

1. The characters are super interesting. Nobody is 100% good or bad.  
2. The plot is full of surprises. You can’t predict what will happen.  
3. The battles are amazing, like in movies!
